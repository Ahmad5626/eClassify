              Founded in 2020, eClassify began with a simple vision: to create a marketplace that puts 
              trust and community at its heart. We recognized that online commerce needed more than just 
              a platform‚Äîit needed a trusted partner that could bring people together safely and securely.

              Starting as a small team of passionate entrepreneurs, we've grown into a global platform 
              serving millions of users worldwide. Our journey has been driven by continuous innovation, 
              user feedback, and an unwavering commitment to creating the best possible experience for 
              buyers and sellers alike.
